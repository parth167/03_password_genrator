# 03_password_generator

1. For this repository, I have created a Javascript Password Generator. This application generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The application combines the HTML, CSS, and now Javascript tools we have been covering in the Bootcamp. 

# The user will be prompted to choose from the following:

* Length of password (must contain at least 8 characters but less than 128)

* Character Type (user must select at least one): Special characters Numeric characters Lowercase characters Uppercase characters

* The end result of the application provides the user a new and secure password. Without a set of prompts, the user would not be able to follow any directions towards generating a new password.
